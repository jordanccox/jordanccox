### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, welcome to my GitHub!

#### ðŸ“– About me 

I've had a passion for computers since I was a kid. I first stumbled into coding when I was about 10 years old and my dad, who owned a web marketing agency, introduced me to HTML. I started teaching myself to build websites using [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and soon began working on projects for my dad's company.

After high school, I joined the Colorado Army National Guard, where I served for 6 years. I was honorably discharged in July, 2023. That same month, I began Parsity.io, a full stack web development bootcamp. Since then, I have been building frontend and backend projects using JavaScript, TypeScript, React + Redux, and Node.js.

#### ðŸ”§ What I'm working on...

I have built a number of projects in vanilla JavaScript, React, and React + Redux. I'm most interested in backend development, unit testing, and system design. Currently, I'm working on building RESTful APIs in TypeScript with MongoDB as a database and learning Go. You can check out my pinned projects to see some of the things I've built that I'm most proud of.

### Hey, welcome to my GitHub!

#### About me

I've had a passion for computers since I was a kid. I first stumbled into coding when I was about 10 years old and my dad, who owned a web marketing agency, introduced me to HTML. I started teaching myself to build websites using [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and soon began working on projects for my dad's company.

After high school, I joined the Colorado Army National Guard, where I served for 6 years. I was honorably discharged in July, 2023. That same month, I began Parsity.io, a full stack web development bootcamp. Since then, I have been building frontend and backend projects using JavaScript, TypeScript, React + Redux, and Node.js.

#### What I'm working on...

I have built a number of projects in vanilla JavaScript, React, and React + Redux. I'm most interested in backend development and system design. Currently, I'm working on building APIs in TypeScript and learning Go. You can checkout my pinned projects to see some of the things I've built that I'm most proud of.
